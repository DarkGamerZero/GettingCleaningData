# Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
This repo is the submission from **Aditya Pisharody** for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 
The UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set used can be obtained here

[UCI HAR dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

# Files
* **Codebook.md** is the codebook file that explains the dataset's variables as well as the operations performed on the data to obtain the final tidy dataset
* **run_analysis.R** is the sript file that performs the operations according to the project's requirements, which are mainly:
  1. Merge the training and test data into one dataset
  2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* **Final.csv** is the CSV file that contains the tidy dataset
